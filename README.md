Nearly all credits to 'just me' for its [Class RichEdit](https://autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=681).
The sample editor and class were slightly edited by 'DigiDon' implement the IRichEditOleCallback interface thanks to adaptation of the AutoIt implementation mentioned below.

All credits to 'Mike O'Neill'.
Taken from A Rich Edit Control That Displays Bitmaps and Other OLE Objects](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9541/A-Rich-Edit-Control-That-Displays-Bitmaps-and-Othe) from [codeproject.com](https://www.codeproject.com)


##AutoIt 
(AutoitRichEdit folder)
The sample editor was adapted from 'ProgAndy' [RichEdit UDF](https://www.autoitscript.com/forum/topic/83763-richedit-udf/)
And the RichEdit class was provided by AutoIt after installation.
